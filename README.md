# Project-II

Many kinds of disease such as brown spot, leaf folder,... seriously damage plants as well as reduce crop productivity if they aren't detected early. This project comes with the hope of managing an effective approach by using an IoT platform and artificial intelligent.

In the range of my personal project, YOLOv8 is used to training model with a dataset of nearly 3000 images from three common diseases seen in rice plant (brown spot, leaf folder and rice blast). The objective is a model that can predict with high accuracy, then sending visualize result to an mobile app.
